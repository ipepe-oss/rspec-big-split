# 0001. Remove placeholder text from README

Date: 2025-06-05

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The README contained placeholder paragraphs from the gem template, including a TODO paragraph and a reference to an example project link that did not exist. These placeholders did not provide value and could confuse users.

## Decision
We removed the introductory TODO paragraph and the todo line under the Example project section. The Example project heading was also removed since no content remained.

## Consequences
The README now begins with a brief description of the gem followed by installation instructions. Documentation reads more smoothly without temporary placeholders.
